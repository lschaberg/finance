# finance
A website implementing mock trading, with live stock quotes for buying and selling and a login system for storing user portfolios.
Implemented using the Flask Python module with a PostgreSQL database and Bootstrap graphics.
Created as part of a summer course adapted from Harvard's CS50 in 2017.
The Yahoo Finance URL used to scrape stock prices was shut down later that year, but feel free to check out the login system at <https://finance-lschaberg.herokuapp.com>
